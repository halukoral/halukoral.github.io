Hey there!
I’m a passionate C++ programmer, a gameplay developer and an aspiring engine developer. I love building gameplay systems and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. In my spare time, I tinker with my own little game engine project — not because I’m an engine developer, but because I enjoy learning how things work under the hood. I’m always exploring low-level graphics stuff and performance tricks just for the fun of it!

Currently, I’m also developing and publishing high-quality code plugins for FAB (Unreal Engine 5) Marketplace. My focus is always on clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Outside of code, I’m a hardcore single-player gamer who lives for immersive stories and atmospheric worlds. Favorites? Definitely *Fallout Series*, *Alien: Isolation*, *Kingdom Come: Deliverance 1 & 2*, *Prey* *Baldur's Gate 3*, *Metro Series*.

Oh, and I have ~~four~~ six adorable cats who occasionally walk on my keyboard and think they’re helping. 🐾
