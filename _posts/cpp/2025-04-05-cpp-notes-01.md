## std::vector< bool >

* special vector
* space-efficient vector
* each element occupies a SINGLE BIT instead of `sizeof(bool)` bytes.
* `std::vector<bool>` is not contiguous

## Narrowing conversion (with std::initializer_list)

```cpp
float f = 3.14f;
int i = f;  // narrowing: decimal part is lost

double d = 3.45678314;
float fx = d; // narrowing: precision (might) loss

//Narrowing and std::initializer_list
int x1 = 3.14; // OK
int x2{3.14}; // ERROR
```

## Example of func pointer 

```cpp
using func = int(int);
int foo(int) { return 0; }

int main() 
{
	func* fp = &foo;
	int (*fpp)(int) = &foo;
}
```

## Type deduction with ternary operator 

```cpp
int x = 2, y = 4;
double z = 5.5;

auto i = x > 3 ? y : z;
// auto : double
// ternary operator is run-time process but
// type deduction is compile-time process
```
