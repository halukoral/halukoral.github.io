## Unevaluated context

* The expression is parsed and analyzed, but NOT executed.
* No opcode generated

```cpp
int x = 10;
size_t s = sizeof(x++);
// x is still 10
```
* sizeof
* decltype
* typeid
* noexcept

## What is `noexcept`?

```cpp
void foo() noexcept; // guarantees no throw

bool b = noexcept(bar()); // // true if bar() guaranteed not to throw
```

## Zero cost abstraction

* What you dont use, you dont pay for
* What you do use, you couldn't hand code better
* Code will be slower to compile

Adding high level programming concept, do not come with run-time cost, only compile time cost.

### Example:

```cpp
template<typename T>
T add(T a, T b) 
{
    return a + b;
}

// with zero-cost abstractions, 
// No function call — it’s inlined.
int result = a + b;
```
