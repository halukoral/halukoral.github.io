## Fully customizable Laser System
---

* Implemented in both C++ and BP.

* Beam and impact effects are created in Niagara. You can create your new beam and impact and easily integrate it into the system.

* Laser beams can be reflected from mirror material and also can be used as triggers.

## How-To
---

### You have to create a new trace channel for laser. 

  > Edit -> Project Settings -> Collision
  {: .prompt-tip }

  <figure class="align-center" style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="/assets/img/fab/laser/T/1.jpg">
      <img src="/assets/img/fab/laser/T/1.jpg"  width="500" alt="">
    </a>
  </figure>


### You can create a new trace channel for the laser in the Collision panel as shown in the image below. 

  <figure class="align-center" style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="/assets/img/fab/laser/T/2.jpg">
      <img src="/assets/img/fab/laser/T/2.jpg"  width="500" alt="">
    </a>
  </figure>

### These settings are saved in DefaultEngine.ini under CollisionProfile section.

  > You need to find out to which GameTraceChannel is set to LineTrace. In my case it is set to ECC_GameTraceChannel1.
  {: .prompt-tip }

  ```cpp
  [/Script/Engine.CollisionProfile]
  +DefaultChannelResponses=(Channel=ECC_GameTraceChannel1,DefaultResponse=ECR_Block,bTraceType=True,bStaticObject=False,Name="LaserTrace")
  ```

### Finally, replace the value on line 16 of LaserEmitter.h with yours.

  ```cpp
  static ECollisionChannel ECC_LaserTrace	= ECollisionChannel::ECC_GameTraceChannel1;
  ```

  And that's it... You can add the BP_LaserEmitter actor to the scene and can set its parameters as you like.
