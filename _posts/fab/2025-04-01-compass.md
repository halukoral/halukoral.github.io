---

A C++ based compass system is a highly customizable compass UI designed to enhance player navigation in Unreal Engine projects.

Key Features:

* Toggleable
  * The system allows you to toggle the compass on and off as needed.
* Vertical position indicators
  * Easily identify whether a location or object is above or below the player.
* Reactive to mysteries 
  * Reacts to hidden or mysterious areas, alerting players when they are near secrets or puzzles.
* Friend and Enemy Indicators
* Landmarks indicator
* Quest indicator
* Implemented in C++ for better performance.

### Simple :

You can see the location of the actors and the directions. 
  <figure class="align-center" style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="/assets/img/fab/compass/Simple.png">
      <img src="/assets/img/fab/compass/Simple.png"  width="700" alt="">
    </a>
  </figure>

### Complex :
In addition to the simple version, you can also see whether the actors are above or below you and how far away they are from you. 
  <figure class="align-center" style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="/assets/img/fab/compass/Complex.png">
      <img src="/assets/img/fab/compass/Complex.png"  width="700" alt="">
    </a>
  </figure>

## How-To :
---

* Just one component (BP_Compass) you need to add to your character and that's all.

  </a>
</figure>

* You can modify all assets via DA_Widget_Simple and DA_Widget_Complex. (These files are derived from the UDataAsset class.)

### DA_Widget_Simple
